Hash-AutoHash-Args

This class simplifies the handling of keyword argument lists. It
replaces Class::AutoClass::Args. The 'new' method accepts a list,
ARRAY, or HASH of keyword=>value pairs, another Hash::AutoHash::Args
object, or any object that can be coerced into a HASH . It normalizes
the keywords to ignore case and leading dashes ('-').

The subclass Hash::AutoHash::Args::V0 is more compatible with the
original.
